## Things I want to..

### test out

- [ ] Get the feel for tooling for a few languages.
- [ ] Pick two of them to create a cli program _(I'm not gonna lie, probably it will be go and rust :)_

### learn more of

Try to do all this in neovim instaed of vscode.

### work more on

Moar here, soon :tm:

### Day 0 ####
**Progress**

None of what I planned, just played with different webscapers.  

**Thoughts**

Not so much done today, perhaps more tomorrow :)

### Day 1 ####
**Progress**

Evrytng was installed (Newly ubuntu install from zero).  
And all the hello world's was done (I know, nothing to phone home about, but now I can verify that the languages is working on my system)

**Thoughts**

Today was fun, things almost worked as I wanted.  
neovim with kickstart and some nice things was installed.  

Today was a good day :)

### Day 2 ###
**Progress**

Mostly fighting with gopls.

**Thoughts**

Tomorrow at work it will be vscode again.   
Going to use vimotions in code until I get the LSPs working.
